## Folder Structure

Each week's folder contains:
- Jupyter notebooks with complete implementation
- Input datasets (CSV, TXT, etc.)
- Additional assets such as plots, screenshots, or output files
- A `README.md` for that week explaining the task and method

The **Final Project** folder includes:
- Cleaned dataset
- Complete modeling notebook
- Report and presentation files
- Markdown README

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CheenoOng09/Data_Mining_Projects.git
```

2. Navigate to a week's folder and install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if present
```

3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `.ipynb` file and run the cells.
