# Week 9 - Association Rule Analysis using Apriori and FP-Growth

This project demonstrates how to mine association rules from transaction data using two popular algorithms: **Apriori** and **FP-Growth**. The goal is to extract meaningful relationships between items in a dataset, typically used for Market Basket Analysis.

## Objective

- Apply the Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms on sample transactional data.
- Interpret support, confidence, and lift values for the extracted association rules.
- Compare results of both algorithms.

## Files

- `Week 9 Association Rule Analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook demonstrating both Apriori and FP-Growth.
- `Week 9 Code.ipynb`: Standalone simplified code with clean outputs and concise visualization.

## Requirements

You must install the required libraries before running the notebooks:

```bash
pip install apyori mlxtend
```

## How to Run

1. Open either notebook in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Execute each cell step by step.
3. Observe and analyze the output association rules generated by both algorithms.

## Output Example (Apriori)

```
Rule: ['Diaper', 'Milk'] -> ['Beer']
Support: 0.60
Confidence: 1.00
Lift: 1.25
```

## Notes

- The Apriori implementation uses the `apyori` package.
- The FP-Growth algorithm is implemented via `mlxtend.frequent_patterns`.
